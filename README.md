These are my assignments on Stegenography and compression algorithms.

## Assignment 1
Need to hide a secret image in a host image.

## Assignment 2
Description: In this problem, you are required to develop a prototype system which encrypts and decrypts an image using the AES algorithm in a specific manner i.e. pixel by pixel. 

It should allow the user to browse an image file (i.e. BMP files) and to choose a save directory. By clicking on “Begin AES” button, the program first encrypts and then decrypts the input image in two ways: 
1) without preserving the image header (in this case, the radio button “Preserve image header” remains unchecked), and 
2) preserving the image header (“Preserve image header” is checked, as shown in the figure). 

Also, you can use either full round AES (in which case, the radio button “Reduced AES – 4 rounds” remains unchecked) or 
4-round AES (“Reduced AES – 4 rounds” is checked) for encryption and decryption. Encryption and decryption time (in millisecond) is shown in the text areas at the bottom of the interface, and the encrypted and decrypted image files are stored in the chosen directory.
